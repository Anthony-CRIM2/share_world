Itâ€™s a video game which you have to collect letters on a map. It is a 1st player game and also multiplayer game, you can play with 
a keyboard and a mouse. And you could play with different roles, like avatar, ironman. 
At the end of the game, you have to fill the letter in the blank of the word with letters you collected. 
Moreover, you can defeat another player with a water gun to make him wet, and then you will get one letter from him.
Each letter will have its own color. This color is corresponding to the color of a word.
