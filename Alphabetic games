Itâ€™s a video game which you have to collect letters on a map. It is a 1st player game and also multiplayer game, you can play with 
a keyboard and a mouse. And you could play with different roles, like avatar, ironman. 
At the end of the game, you have to fill the letter in the blank of the word with letters you collected. 
Moreover, you can  another player with a water gun to fall down him and collect his letters.
Each letters will have a specific color. This color is corresponding to the color of a word. 

We also create a website. It's on this website that you will create your word with letter. This part of the project will be Open. In this way, 
everybody can add another dictionary in another language. 
In the future, we also want to open the content of the game, that's to say if people want to have math in the game, it will possible. 

We will develop the game with Unreal Engine 4 (https://www.unrealengine.com/) and the Website will be develop on Symfony
(https://symfony.com/).
