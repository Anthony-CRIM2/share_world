General goal: We want to create tools/objects to teach science in a playful way.
The project will consist in creating a kit containing several of these objects.
We want to keep these object as cheap and simple as possible to diffuse them.

Steps:
- Clearly define the concept we want to teach, how, and to who.
- Design the object.
- Create a prototype.
- Test it.

First object: *insert a cool name here*
We want to explain physical laws that are involved in balance (gravity forces, center of gravity...)
We want to build a kind of hanger, on which you can attach mass at some point.
The idea is to invite child to expresse their idea on the balancing of this object when you use different mass.
So we want to put some "clues" on the object (like gradution on the hanger).
